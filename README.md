# Role Based Access Control System

This project is a **User Management System** developed using **React.js**, designed to simplify the management of users and roles. It features a clean, table-based interface where you can effortlessly add, update, or remove users and roles. Each user record includes essential details such as **name**, **email**, **role**, and their **status (active/inactive)**. The application ensures data persistence by leveraging **localStorage**, allowing user information to remain intact even after refreshing the page. This system offers an efficient and user-friendly solution for handling basic role and user management tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** for building the user interface and managing state.
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, utility-first styling.
- **localStorage** for persistent data storage, ensuring user data remains across page reloads.

## Features

- **Add Users**: Easily add new users by filling out a form with their name, email, role, and profile picture. The email is validated to ensure itâ€™s in the correct format before saving, and you can upload a profile picture from your PC.
- **Edit Users**: Modify existing user details by clicking the "Edit" button in the user table. The form pre-fills with the user's current information, allowing you to update their name, email, role, and profile picture.
- **Delete Users**: Remove users directly from the user table with a simple click. Deleted users are permanently removed from the system.
- **Profile Picture Upload**: Users can upload a profile picture from their computer, which will be displayed alongside their details.
- **Responsiveness**: The app is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices. Tables and forms automatically adjust to fit various screen sizes.
